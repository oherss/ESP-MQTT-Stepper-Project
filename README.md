# ESP MQTT Stepper Project

This project is an integration between the TMC 2209 stepper driver with an ESP 32-S3 chip and code that allows the motor to connect via MQTT with a custom protocol.
The code parts of this project are made to be compatible with the PD Stepper hardware project.
The hardware is also inspired by this project, but without some of the extra bells and whistles, like PD power, expansion ports and buttons.

# This is a student project
Which means I am doing this for an exam and may not maintain this repo in the future, this is mostly a proof-of-concept :)
